## Download Repository

To download a copy of the code repository, open up a new Terminal window, navigate into your directory where you want to store your code, and paste the following command:

```console

git clone https://github.com/fec9-wendys/project-atelier.git

```

Navigate into the root project folder

```console

cd project-atelier/

```

Open up the project in your root directory with your preferred code editor. If you are using Visual Studio Code you may use the following command:

```console

code .

```


## Running the Project

To run the project files, you must first install all package dependencies in a terminal window. You may use the same Terminal window as before, or you may open up a new Terminal window within your VS Code editor with the shortcut (<kbd>âŒ˜ Command</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd>) in Mac or (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd>) in Windows.

Install npm dependencies with the npm install command in the terminal:


```js

npm install

```

Next you should run the build and start command into two separate terminals.

```js

npm run build

```

```js

npm run start

```

The application will now run on your local host with the port value of 3000. Simply type `localhost:3000` onto your browser and now you are running our application.
